This is a repository for sparse matrix and matrix mutliplications in C.

In this version of matrix multiplication the matrix is self-populating in the program. 
    * It can handle up to a 127 x 127 matrix.
    * It prints to a console and files.
    * I did this with memory effeciency in mind.  
    * I have also included a timer for the computation.
